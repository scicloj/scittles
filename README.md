# scittles

Creating web pages using [Scittle](https://github.com/babashka/scittle)

## What is it?

This project is a (work-in-progress) attempt to extract the Scittle-related functionality out of [Clay](https://github.com/scicloj/clay).

Potentially, it can become a tiny library for the creation of static web pages.
